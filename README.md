Minimal image hosting powered by **GitHub + jsDelivr** âš¡

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

All images must be placed inside a subdirectory. For better organization, you can create multiple folders for different categories. Uploading images directly to the root directory is not permitted.

Here is an example of a valid structure:

```
px/
â””â”€â”€ demo/
    â”œâ”€â”€ test.png
    â””â”€â”€ example.jpg
```

## ðŸ“¸ Usage

1.  **Upload to a Subdirectory** 
    Create a new folder within this repository and push your images to it.

2.  **Get the CDN link** 
    Use the following format to access your image via jsDelivr:

    > `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cvyuan/px@main/<your-directory-name>/<your-image-name>`

3.  **Embed in Markdown / HTML**Â Â 
    For example, if you uploaded an image named `test.png` inside a directory named `demo`:

    ```markdown
    ![demo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cvyuan/px@main/demo/test.png)
    ```
